# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

This analysis gives insight of machine learning and neural networks, features used in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. The dataset is a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations with a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization.

## Results

Below are lists and images to show the process to machine learning and neural networks
